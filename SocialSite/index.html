                    <h2>The Era of Electric Cars Is Here</h2>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <br>
                          <h3>Introduction</h3>

                          <p>For a long time many people have have overlooked electric and hybrid cars
                            as being to expansive or not offering the performance they are looking for
                            but that time has passed. Since the creation of Tesla, the leading electric
                            car manufacturer, performance, price and range have all been taken to a new level.
                            The US car manufacturer has a range of different models that are meant to meet everyones
                            different needs from a luxurious 4 door sedan to an AWD long range SUV to a supercar
                            that is the fastest production car to be available on the market today.
                          </p>
                          <br>
                        </li>
                      <li>
                          <h3>Costs</h3>
                          <p>Many people have overlooked Tesla and electric cars altogether based soley upon
                          price. Although some of the models of that are offered by Tesla can be quite a bit higher than
                        the average car price in the US, the company has offered a more affordable model 3 which after tax rebates from the
                        government brings the cost lower than the average US car price at $33,000.
                      </p>
                      <br>
                        </li>
                      <li>
                          <h3>Performance</h3>
                          <p>Tesla as a company strives for performance. The original idea that electric cars would never
                          be able to compete with gas powered cars has come to a screeching hault. Since the debut of the model X
                          it has been noted world wide that electric cars will outperform gas cars because of the instant
                          power of electric motors. As of 2017 Telsa holds the award for fastest production car on the market which is a fully elctric model.</p>

                          <h3>Emmissions</h3>
                          <p>Since the introduction of fully electric cars many studies have been conducted to show the
                            the benefits to the environment and how much of an impact these cars would have on emmissions.
                            The studies show that consumers who have switched over to fully electric cars from gas cars who drive the
                            same amount have cut down on harmful emmissions by nearly 50%. Imagine if we all could switch to electric!

                    or at home by the household charging station which is installed in your garage. By driving an Electric car,

                    The Model 3 is a smaller, simpler, more affordable electric car.
                     Although it is the newest vehicle, Model 3 is not “Version 3”
                     or the most advanced Tesla. Like Model S, it is designed to be the safest car in its class.
                     Designed to attain the highest safety ratings in every category, Model 3 achieves 220 miles
                     of range while starting at only $35,000 before incentives.

                    In 2015, the average new car price was $33,560. The Model 3 has a target price of $35,000,
                    but the net price will actually be lower for most buyers. Electric vehicles currently qualify
                    for a $7,500 federal tax credit. So, if you pay at least that much in federal income tax, your
                    tax bill will be $7,500 lower the year after you buy a Model 3 (or your refund will be $7,500 higher).
                     So, the Tesla’s net cost will be $27,500 or lower for most buyers. This puts it well below the current
                     average price American car buyers are paying for a new car.

                    The 200 kilowatt-hour battery pack will give the car a 620-mile range. You’ll be able to travel from L.A.
                    to San Francisco and back, at highway speeds, without recharging. The vehicle has three separate motors -
                    one powering the front wheels and two powering the rear. It will be all wheel drive and will have torque steering.
                    Prices for the Roadster will start at $200,000 which, when compared to current supercars with specs like these, is a bit of a steal.
                    The Roadster 2.0 will be available in 2020 as the fastest production car on the market with huge bang for your buck!

                    The Nissan LEAF offers a standard city range,
                    a fairly roomy and comfortable interior,
                    5 seats, and decent acceleration. With
                    a price just over $20,000 after the US federal
                    tax credit and under $20,000 in California with the
                    ZEV rebate, it’s one to consider if you’re on the
                    market for an affordable electric car. More than 300,000
                    Leafs have been sold worldwide through January 2018,
                    making the Leaf the world's all-time best-selling
                    highway-capable electric car in history.

                    ​The BMW i3 is a B-class, high-roof hatchback
                    manufactured and marketed by BMW with an electric
                     powertrain using rear wheel drive via a single-speed
                     transmission. Its underfloor li-ion battery pack is
                     offered in two capacities as well as with an optional
                    range-extending gasoline engine. The i3 was BMW's first
                    mass-produced zero emissions vehicle
                  </p>

                    Home charging takes less than 3 hours (0-80 per cent charge)
                    with the BMW i Wallbox Pure and allows you to drive for around 2 cents per mile.
                    Over a year that would save the average driver $1500 compared to a
                    petrol car. But there are other savings. Zero emissions cars pay
                    zero road tax. They’re also cheaper to insure compared to petrol-powered cars.

                    With an average fuel economy of 32 mpg in the

                    ​Renault Zoe is a five-door supermini electric
                    car produced by the French manufacturer Renault.
                    Earlier Zoes have a 22 kWh lithium-ion battery pack
                    that delivers a range between 130 mi and 150 mi.
                    It’s one of the most affordable electric cars on
                    the market right now, and it certainly competes
                    with the most economical EVs in terms of range,
                    style, and performance, but there’s one factor
                    that contrasts many others

                    Perhaps it is in the buoyant and spunky name,
                    Zoe. Perhaps it’s the good quality for price.
                    Perhaps it’s the style and size. In the end,
                    it’s probably just all of the above. Either way,
                    the eco-consciousness of this wonderful EV combined
                    with other compelling consumer benefits to make it the
                    top selling electric car in Europe last year yet again.

                      <br>
                      <p>Since the introduction of hybrid and fully electric vehicles
                      there has been a noticeable reduction in greenhouses gases in the
                      areas where their are high numbers of these types of vehicles.
                      A great example of this reduction can be seen in Los Angeles and the
                      greater Southern California area where smog and emmissions have been
                      a huge problem. As electric cars are trending and more and more hit the
                      road, the reduction in emmissions and greenhouse gases will continue
                      rise. </p>

                      <h4>Cutting Fuel Costs</h4>
                      <br>
                      <p>The average driver with a gas powered car annually consumes about
                      6100 gallons of gas per year at an average cost of $18,000 per year (based upon
                      cars with a average mpg of 27 and driving average of 10k miles per year). The
                      average driver with a hybrid vehicle annually consumes about 3300 gallons of gas per
                      year at an average cost of $9800 per year (based upon hybrid cars with an average mpg
                      of 50 and driving 10k miles per year). The average driver with a fully electric vehicle
                      spend no money gas but about $5200 on electricity to charge the batteries. On average electric
                      vehicle owners save about $13,000 per year and help reduce greenhouse emmissions.

                      years later we are continuing to see this trend. The tax breaks and refund amounts varies by state
                      and brand of vehcile but are making electric cars more affordable than ever. In California there
                      are also other incentives such as free fast-lane access and some free tolls. We are also starting to see
                      many states building free charging stations in urban areas and most of the modern electric cars map these out.
