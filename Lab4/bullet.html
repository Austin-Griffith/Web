      <h1>Bullet Trains</h1>

          <p>This is the first bullet train you have ever ridden. You didn't feel it but you were going faster than most small planes!!</p>

          <p>You're now entering Spain and since the EU light border policies you grab your bags and exit the station! </p>
          <p> You have a few days in <a href="Spain.html">Spain</a> but you're next stop is <a href="France.html">France</a></p>
          <p> Although you miss the <a href="root.html">home</a> this is a great time to meet new people and explore the <a href="travel.html">World</a></p>
