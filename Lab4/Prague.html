      <h1>Welcome to Prague</h1>

          <p>For the first time on your trip you are taking a plane to a new destination instead of a train.</p>

          <p>You're now entering the Czech Republic where beer flows like water and is cheaper than bubble gum.</p>
          <p>You're now deeper into the trip and not even thinking about <a href="root.html">home</a> </p>
          <p>but rather all the places you have been and seen in <a href="Europe.html">Europe</a> so far.</p>
          <p>Sadly Prague is the last stop on your wild trip as you have already been to three different countries!</p>
          <p>After many beers and pasta dishes you are ready to head back <a href="overseas.html">overseas</a> for the long 14 hour haul <a href="root.html">home</a>.</p>
